## Uplift modeling VS conventional predictive model: A reliable machine learning model to solve employee turnover [Contribution guidelines for this project](turnover_versus_uplift_eng.ipynb)
**Background** : Employee turnover is the loss of talent in the workforce that can be costly for a company. Uplift modeling is one of the prescriptive methods in machine learning models that not only predict an outcome but also prescribe a solution. Recent studies are focusing on the conventional predictive models to predict employee turnover rather than uplift modeling.<br>
**Aim**: In this research, we analyze whether the uplifting model has better performance than the conventional predictive model in solving employee turnover.<br>
**Methodology**: Performance comparison between the two methods was carried out by experimentation using two synthetic datasets and one real dataset.<br>
**Results**: The results show that despite the conventional predictive model yields an average prediction accuracy of 84%; it only yields a success rate of 50% to target the right employee with a retention program on the three datasets. By contrast, the uplift model only yields an average accuracy of 67% but yields a consistent success rate of 100% in targeting the right employee with a retention program.
